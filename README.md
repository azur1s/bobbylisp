# Hades
Programming language that compiles to JavaScript

Note: The syntax can still be changed and also the compile target (I'm still finding out what target will suit this the best) if you have an idea, feel free to create an issues about it.

# Prerequistie
- `node` or any JavaScript runner
- Rust (if you're going to build from source)

# TODO
- Optimization (IR)
- Error reporting (probably with Ariadne crate)
- Standard library
- Runtime stuff

# License
